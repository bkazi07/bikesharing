# Module 14 Challenge: Bikesharing

## Overview of the statistical analysis: 
	The purpose of this challenge was to evaluate and visualize the Citi bike data that was 
	previously being worked with for New York City. It was broken down by gender, time, and 		
	weekdays and this was used to determine the type of customer. For the deliverables of the 
	project, the trip duration had to be changed to a date time format. The visualizations for 
	the trip analysis had to be created through Tableau as well.

## Results (will be referring to the screenshots in the results folder on GitHub)
The first screenshot was for the checkout times for the user's most active time within the first hour.
The second screenshot was for the checkout times by gender. It could be seen that the majority of the users are males and they tend to have a longer trip duration as well.
The third screenshot was for trips by weekday for each hour. The majority of activity is during the week at about 8am and from 5-7pm. Another trend that could be seen was that Saturday from 11am to 6pm was a very popular time as well.
The fourth screenshot was for trips by gender by weekday per hour. 
The fifth was a heat map showing user trips by gender by the weekday. It could be seen that most of the subscribers are males. 
Citibikes are used by mostly males and their use time is around the traditional 9-5 working hours during the week as well as Saturday. Most of the trips had under 20 minutes of ride time. The user base of Citi is made up mostly by subscribers and not random people. 

## Summary: 
	Bike sharing on the month of August of 2019, serviced 2.3M customers. Most of the customers 
	can be identified as people that live in the city as the number of subscribes of the service 
	represents 81% of the total customers. The data available shows that males represent the 
	majority of the customers and the age that uses the service the most are born between 1985 
	and 1995. This information helps the company to understand its public target as well as focus 
	on others age groups to expand their services. They can try to advertise to people that are 
	not subscribers as well as appeal to all age groups since bikes can be ridden by anybody.
